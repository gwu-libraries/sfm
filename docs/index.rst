Social Feed Manager (SFM)
=========================

Social Feed Manager is open source software for libraries, archives, cultural heritage institutions and research
organizations. It empowers those communities' researchers, faculty, students, and archivists to define and create
collections of data from social media platforms. Social Feed Manager will harvest from Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr,
and Sina Weibo and is extensible for other platforms. In addition to collecting data from those platforms' APIs,
it will collect linked web pages and media.

This site provides documentation for installation and usage of SFM. See the `Social Feed Manager project site <http://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/>`_ for full information about the project's objectives, roadmap, and updates.
