Messaging
=========

RabbitMQ
--------

RabbitMQ is used as a message broker.

The RabbitMQ managagement console is exposed at ``http://<your docker host>:15672/``.
The username is ``sfm_user``. The password is the value of ``RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS``
in ``secrets.env``.

Publishers/consumers
--------------------

* The hostname for RabbitMQ is ``rabbit`` and the port is 5672.
* It cannot be guaranteed that the RabbitMQ docker container will be up and ready when
  any other container is started. Before starting, wait for a connection to be available
  on port 5672 on ``rabbit``. See ``appdeps.py`` for docker application dependency
  support.
* Publishers/consumers may not assume that the requisite exchanges/queues/bindings
  have previously been created. They must declare them as specified below.

Exchange
--------

``sfm_exchange`` is a durable topic exchange to be used for all messages. All
publishers/consumers must declare it.::

    #Declare sfm_exchange
    channel.exchange_declare(exchange="sfm_exchange",
                             type="topic", durable=True)

Queues
------

All queues must be declared durable.::

    #Declare harvester queue
    channel.queue_declare(queue="harvester",
                          durable=True)
