=================
 API Credentials
=================

Accessing the APIs of social media platforms requires credentials for
authentication (also knows as API keys). Social Feed Manager supports managing
those credentials.

Credentials/authentication allow a user to collect data through a platform’s
API. For some social media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Tumblr), Limits are
placed on methods and rate of collection on a per credential basis.

SFM users are responsible for creating their own new credentials so that
they can control their own collection rates and can ensure that they are
following each platform’s API policies.

Most API credentials have two parts: an application credential and a user
credential.(Flickr is the exception -- only an application credential
is necessary.)

For more information about platform-specific policies, consult the documentation
for each social media platform's API.

----------------------
 Managing credentials
----------------------

SFM supports two approaches to managing credentials: adding credentials and
connecting credentials. Both of these options are available from the
Credentials page.

Adding credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For this approach, a user gets the application and/or user credential from the
social media platform and provide them to SFM by completing a form. More
information on getting credentials is below.

Connecting credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*This is the easiest approach for users.*

For this approach, SFM is configured with the application credentials for the
social media platform by the systems administrator. The user credentials are
obtained by the user being redirected to the social media website to give
permission to SFM to access her account.

SFM is configured with the application credentials in the ``.env``.
If additional management is necessary, it can be performed using the Social
Accounts section of the Admin interface.

 Platform specifics
--------------------

Twitter
  Twitter credentials can be obtained from `the Twitter API
  <https://apps.twitter.com/>`_.

  For detailed instructions, see :ref:`twitter-credentials`.

  It is recommended to change the application permissions to read-only.  You
  *must* provide a callback URL, but the URL you provide doesn't matter.

Flickr
  Flickr credentials can be obtained from
  `the Flickr API
  <https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/>`_.

  For detailed instructions, see :ref:`flickr-credentials`.

Tumblr
  Tumblr credentials can be obtained from
  `the Tumblr API <https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps>`_.

  For detailed instructions, see :ref:`tumblr-credentials`.


Weibo
^^^^^
For instructions on obtaining Weibo credentials, see `this guide
<http://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2016-04-26-weibo-api-guide>`_.

To use the connecting credentials approach for Weibo, the redirect URL must
match the application's actual URL and use port 80.

--------------------------
Adding Twitter Credentials
--------------------------


The easiest way to set up Twitter credentials is to connect them to your
personal Twitter account (or another Twitter account you control). If you want
more fine-tuned control, you can manually set up application-level credentials
(see below).

To connect to Twitter credentials, first sign in to Twitter with the account you
want to use. Then, on the Credentials page, click *Connect to Twitter*. A
window will pop up from Twitter, asking you for authorization. Click authorize,
and your credentials will automatically connect.

Once credentials are connected, you can start :ref:`guide-creating-collections`.

Manually adding Twitter Credentials, rather than connecting them automatically
using your Twitter account (see above), gives you greater control over your
credentials and allows you to use multiple credentials.

To manually add credentials:
  * **Navigate to** https://apps.twitter.com/.
  * **Sign in to Twitter and select "Create New App."**
  * **Enter a name for the app** like *Social Feed Manager* or the name of a new
    Collection Set.
  * **Enter a description.** You may copy and paste:
    *This is a social media research and archival tool, which collects data for
    academic researchers through an accessible user interface.*
    * **Enter a Website** such as the SFM url. Any website will work.
  * **Enter a Callback URL** such as the same url used for the website field.
  * **Review and agree to the Twitter Developer Agreement** and click *Create
    your Twitter Application.*
  * Recommended:
      * Click on your new application.
      * Navigate to the *Permissions* tab.
      * Select *Read only* then *Update settings*.
  * **Go to the Credentials page of SFM,** and click *Add Twitter Credential*.
  * Fill out all fields:
      * On the Twitter apps page (https://apps.twitter.com/) click your new
        application.
      * Navigate to the *Keys and Access Tokens* tab.
      * From the top half of the page, copy and paste into the matching fields
        in SFM: *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret*.
      * From the bottom half of the page, copy and paste into the matching
      fields in SFM: *Access Token* and *Access Token Secret*.
  * **Click** *Save*
