This release of SFM focuses on maintenance, upgrading the Python version to 3.8 and updating related dependencies and tests. We also are continuing to update documentation about installation and using Docker. Thanks to @sebastian-nagel for several improvements. 

Details are in the [sfm-ui 2.5.0 release notes](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-ui/releases/tag/2.5.0). It's straightforward to upgrade, but if you're behind a few versions, be sure to check out the release notes for [version 2.4.0](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-ui/releases/tag/2.4.0) and [version 2.3.0](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-ui/releases/tag/2.3.0) for some required new configurations and upgrade steps. General upgrading instructions for SFM instances are described in the [SFM documentation](https://sfm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html#upgrading).
