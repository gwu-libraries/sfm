In between GW’s spring break and late season snow storm (well, storm is a bit of an exaggeration), we squeaked in [version 1.6](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-docker/releases/tag/1.6.0) of Social Feed Manager.  This release was our first opportunity to implement usability improvements that came out of our work with UX expert [Cory Lebson](https://lebsontech.com/).

Rather than attempt to describe the improvements, I’m going to gesture at them with pictures.

This barely made a dent in our [UX tickets](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AUX); expect more in upcoming releases.

In case you missed it, check out Soomin Park’s [recent blog post](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-03-15-releasing-datasets) on publishing social media datasets to Dataverse. (As a good companion reading, I’d recommend Sara Mannheimer and Elizabeth Hull's [article](http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/12661/Mannheimer-Hull-Sharing-Selves-2017.pdf) on the legal and ethical considerations of social media data from the perspective of data curators.) 

Also, after deep contemplation of the considerations for establishing a social media archiving program, we've released "[Building Social Media Archives: Collection Development Guidelines](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/resources/guidelines)". (Rachel Trent, Vakil Smallen, and Christie Peterson led the work on developing this resource; the rest of the team just chimed in with our two cents.) Feedback/discussion is welcome.

And coming soon: Yonah Bromberg Gaber is working on a blog post on collecting tweets based on geotagging.
